Analyze and redesign the application's user flow to enhance clarity and usability, focusing on the journey from the homepage to program discovery, application submission, and applicant login. Specifically:

- Ensure all CTA buttons on the homepage link to available and relevant pages.
- Clearly distinguish between different programs (e.g., scholarships, 'free Jamb') with intuitive navigation and descriptions.
- Provide a prominent, clearly labeled login option for applicants, accessible from the homepage and relevant subpages.
- Restructure the homepage layout to guide users seamlessly toward program exploration and application processes.
- Address UI/UX inconsistencies, ensuring a cohesive and accessible design throughout.
- Reference established UI/UX best practices (e.g., [Nielsen Norman Group Guidelines](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)) and, if possible, include wireframes or annotated mockups to illustrate proposed changes.
